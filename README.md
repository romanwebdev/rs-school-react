# Forms: Uncontrolled & React Hook Form

This branch contains my implementation of **React forms** using both **uncontrolled inputs** and the **React Hook Form** library as part of the **React course** at [Rolling Scopes School (RS School)](https://rs.school/).

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered
- **Uncontrolled Forms** â€“ Managing form state using **refs** (`useRef`) instead of React state.
- **React Hook Form** â€“ Implementing form handling with the `react-hook-form` library for better performance and validation.
- **Validation with Zod** â€“ Using **Zod** for schema-based form validation with `react-hook-form`.
- **Form Submission & Handling** â€“ Processing form data efficiently.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- React (`useRef` for uncontrolled inputs)
- React Hook Form (`react-hook-form` library)
- Zod (`zod` for validation)

This branch demonstrates **two approaches to handling forms in React**â€”the **traditional uncontrolled approach** and the **modern, optimized React Hook Form approach**.
