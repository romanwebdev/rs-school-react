# Class Components & Error Boundary

This branch contains my implementation of **class components** and **error boundaries** as part of the **React course** at [Rolling Scopes School (RS School)](https://rs.school/).

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered
- **Class Components** â€“ Understanding the lifecycle methods and managing state in class-based components.
- **Error Boundaries** â€“ Implementing error boundaries to catch and handle JavaScript errors in the component tree.
- **Project Setup** â€“ Initializing a React project with the necessary dependencies.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- React (Class Components)
- Error Boundaries (`componentDidCatch`, `getDerivedStateFromError`)
- React Lifecycle Methods

This branch serves as a reference for working with **legacy React features** before the shift to function components and hooks.
