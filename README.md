# Next.js with Pages API

This branch contains my implementation of **Next.js with the Pages API** as part of the **React course** at [Rolling Scopes School (RS School)](https://rs.school/).

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered

- **SSR & SSG** â€“ Using **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** for optimized performance.
- **Dynamic Routing** â€“ Creating dynamic pages with parameterized URLs.
- **Data Fetching** â€“ Working with `getServerSideProps` to fetch data on the server.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- Next.js
- Pages API (`pages`)
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

This branch explores **full-stack capabilities in Next.js**, handling both frontend rendering and backend API requests within the same application.
