# React Router, Hooks & Testing

This branch contains my implementation of **React Router, React Hooks, and Testing** as part of the **React course** at [Rolling Scopes School (RS School)](https://rs.school/).

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered
- **React Router** â€“ Setting up client-side routing, working with `BrowserRouter`, `Route`, `Link`, and `useNavigate`.
- **React Hooks** â€“ Using `useState`, `useEffect`, and custom hooks for interacting with local storage.
- **Testing** â€“ Writing unit and integration tests using React Testing Library and Vitest.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- React Router
- React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.)
- React Testing Library & Vitest

This branch demonstrates essential concepts for building **single-page applications (SPA)** with navigation, state management, and testing.
